## Experiment2 : Wiener Filter

- Implement Wiener filtering with Python, and compare the image restoration results under the three conditions of unknown signal-to-noise ratio, known signal-to-noise ratio, and known image correlation function.

## Experiment3 : DPCM Coding

- Encode and decode a grayscale image with DPCM, compare the difference between reconstructed images with different scales (1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit), and calculate the PSNR and SSIM of the reconstructed image with Python.
